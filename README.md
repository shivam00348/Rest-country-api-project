# Rest-country-api-project

A REST country API project is essentially a web-based application that allows users to interact with a database of information about countries. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we create the visual interface where users can input queries or select options. Then, we use JavaScript's Fetch API to communicate with a RESTful API, which serves as the database containing information about countries. This API allows us to retrieve data based on user requests, such as country names or codes, population, capital cities, and more. Finally, we display the retrieved information on the web page for the user to see and interact with. So, in short, it's a project that lets users explore and learn about countries through a web interface.
